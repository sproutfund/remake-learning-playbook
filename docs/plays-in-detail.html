              <p>Created by <a href="http://www.sproutfund.org/" target="_blank">The Sprout Fund</a> as a digital &amp; tangible product, the Playbook documents the process and outcomes of both the Pittsburgh region&rsquo;s efforts to create a community-wide learning innovation network, and specific projects the network has catalyzed.</p>
              <p>The Playbook captures the spirit and substance of the <a href="http://remakelearning.org/network" target="_blank">Remake Learning Network</a> in action. It covers the theory and practice of building learning innovation networks, the resources and strategies required to put networks into action, and the impact of the network in schools, museums, libraries, communities, and more.</p>
